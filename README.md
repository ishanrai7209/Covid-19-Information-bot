# Covid-19-Information-bot
The project is built to make it easier for the user to get the most details about covid-19 and its vaccination details such as symptoms, types of vaccines, and prevention methods. In case the user enters only a keyword the chatbot will immediately go through the data provided and can give an appropriate answer to the user. The interface of the program is so easy that everyone can easily go through it and get help. In case any new queries are found, those can be easily added to the server. In case the server gets down, there are some pre-installed answers which can solve basic queries.
